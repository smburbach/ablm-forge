"""Shared fixtures for the ``ablm.data`` test suite.

Provides real sequence-parquet fixtures used by the dataset/collate/loader tests:
a tiny multi-shard parquet of *real* protein sequences (Phase 3), with an
optional ``masking_weights`` column (Phase 4/10). Sequences are sliced from the
existing ``tests/fixtures/training/test_sequences.parquet`` so fixtures stay
real-data-backed.

Real structure/variant/downstream fixtures live under ``tests/data/fixtures/``
(see ``tests/data/fixtures/README.md``); tests ``pytest.skip`` when absent.
